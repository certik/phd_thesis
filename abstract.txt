Physics in Screening Environments
=================================

In the current study, we investigated atoms in screening environments like
plasmas.

It is common practice to extract physical data, such as temperature and
electron densities, from plasma experiments. We present results that address
inherent computational difficulties that arise when the screening approach is
extended to include the interaction between the atomic electrons. We show that
there may be an ambiguity in the interpretation of physical properties, such as
temperature and charge density, from experimental data due to the opposing
effects of electron-nucleus screening and electron-electron screening.

The focus of the work, however, is on the resolution of inherent computational
challenges that appear already at the Hartree-Fock level. Furthermore, as
examples of post Hartree-Fock calculations, we show second-order Green's
function results and many body perturbation theory results of second order.

A self-contained derivation of all necessary equations has been included.  The
accuracy of the implementation of the method is established by comparing
standard unscreened results for various atoms and molecules against literature
for Hartree-Fock as well as Green's function and many body perturbation
theory.

The main results of the thesis are presented in the chapter called Screened
Results, where the behavior of several atomic systems depending on
electron-electron and electron-nucleus Debye screening was studied.

Finally, we present and discuss results obtained for screened interactions. We
also examine thoroughly the computational details of the calculations and
particular implementations of the method.
