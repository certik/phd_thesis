{\bf Abstract}
\end{center}

In the current study, we investigated atoms in screening environments like
plasmas.

It is common practice to extract physical data, such as temperature and
electron densities, from plasma experiments. We present results that address
inherent computational difficulties that arise when the screening approach is
extended to include the interaction between the atomic electrons. We show that
there may arise an ambiguity in the interpretation of physical properties, such
as
temperature and charge density, from experimental data due to the opposing
effects of electron-nucleus screening and electron-electron screening.

The focus of the work, however, is on the resolution of inherent computational
challenges that appear in the computation of two-particle matrix elements.
Those enter already at the Hartree-Fock level. Furthermore, as
examples of post Hartree-Fock calculations, we show second-order Green's
function results and many body perturbation theory results of second order.

A self-contained derivation of all necessary equations has been included.  The
accuracy of the implementation of the method is established by comparing
standard unscreened results for various atoms and molecules against literature
for Hartree-Fock as well as Green's function and many body perturbation
theory.

The main results of the thesis are presented in the chapter called Screened
Results, where the behavior of several atomic systems depending on
electron-electron and electron-nucleus Debye screening was studied.
The computer code that we have developed has been made available for anybody to
use.

Finally, we present and discuss results obtained for screened interactions. We
also examine thoroughly the computational details of the calculations and
particular implementations of the method.

I would like to thank my Ph.D. advisor Dr. Peter Winkler, for all the time that
he has devoted to me, teaching me atomic physics and guiding me through my
Ph.D studies.

I thank my Ph.D. committee members Dr. David M. Leitner, Dr. Yasuhiko Sentoku,
Dr. Karen Spears and Dr. Sergey A. Varganov, for their support and always being
ready to help. I
thank Dr. Sergey A. Varganov for all the discussions and explaining to me many
methods in quantum chemistry, pointing me to relevant literature and serving on
my committee.  I also wish to thank
Dr. Joseph I. Cline for initially serving on my committee and helping me with
administrative and other issues. I am indebted to Dr. Pavel \v Sol\' in for
inviting me to Reno, his time and his help getting me integrated in the USA, as
well as serving on my committee for two years. I wish to thank Dr. Bernhard
Bach for helping me with teaching labs as well as explaining many physics
topics. I would like to thank my former advisors and friends Dr. Ji\v r\'i
Vack\'a\v r, Dr. Ji\v r\'i Ple\v sek, Dr. Fernando Perez, Dr. Brian Granger and
Dr. Anton\'in Fejfar for their help and encouragement.

I thank Dr. John. E. Pask for being my advisor at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, teaching me finite element method for electronic
structure calculations as well as introducing me to modern Fortran and his
continuous help through my Ph.D. studies. John has provided many useful
suggestions for improving the thesis as well.

Most importantly I would like to thank my wife Michelle for her relentless and
patient support during all the late nights that I worked on my Ph.D., her
encouragement as well as proofreading.
