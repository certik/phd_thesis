@article{Alizadegan2010,
abstract = {Since the seminal contribution of Roothaan, quantum chemistry methods are traditionally expressed using finite basis sets comprised of smooth and continuous functions (atom-centered Gaussians) to describe the electronic degrees of freedom. Although this approach proved quite powerful, it is not well suited for large basis sets because of linear dependence problems and ill conditioning of the required matrices. The finite element method (FEM), on the other hand, is a powerful numerical method whose convergence is also guaranteed by variational principles and can be achieved systematically by increasing the number of degrees of freedom and/or the polynomial order of the shape functions. Here we apply the real-space FEM to Hartree-Fock calculations in three dimensions. The method produces sparse, banded Hermitian matrices while allowing for variable spatial resolution. This local-basis approach to electronic structure theory allows for systematic convergence and promises to provide an accurate and efficient way toward the full ab initio analysis of materials at larger scales. We introduce a new acceleration technique for evaluating the exchange contribution within FEM and explore the accuracy and robustness of the method for some selected test atoms and molecules. Furthermore, we applied a divide-and-conquer (DC) method to the finite-element Hartree-Fock ab initio electronic-structure calculations in three dimensions. This DC approach leads to facile parallelization and should enable reduced scaling for large systems.},

From the discussion of diverse systems, the (often underestimated) complexity of their physical and chemical behavior emerges, and hence the importance of an accurate description and the need for a careful inspection of the experimental data, with which comparison is often intrinsically difficult. The ambition of this review is to help establish a basis not only for a nonsuperficial reading of the existing literature, but also for a constructive approach with computations to the challenge posed by recent promising applications of fullerenes in nanotechnology, optoelectronics, and biology.},

abstract = {Here a three-dimensional fully numerical (i.e., chemical basis-set free) method [P. F. Batcho, Phys. Rev. A 57, 6 (1998)], is formulated and applied to the calculation of the electronic structure of general multicenter Hamiltonian systems. The numerical method is presented and applied to the solution of Schr\"{o}dinger-type operators, where a given number of nuclei point singularities is present in the potential field. The numerical method combines the rapid "exponential" convergence rates of modern spectral methods with the multiresolution flexibility of finite element methods, and can be viewed as an extension of the spectral element method. The approximation of cusps in the wave function and the formulation of multicenter nuclei singularities are efficiently dealt with by the combination of a coordinate transformation and a piecewise variational spectral approximation. The complete system can be efficiently inverted by established iterative methods for elliptical partial differential equations; an application of the method is presented for atomic, diatomic, and triatomic systems, and comparisons are made to the literature when possible. In particular, local density approximations are studied within the context of Kohn-Sham density functional theory, and are presented for selected subsets of atomic and diatomic molecules as well as the ozone molecule.},

abstract = {A systematic evaluation of the ionization energy within the GW approximation is carried out for the first row atoms, from H to Ar. We describe a Gaussian basis implementation of the GW approximation, which does not resort to any further technical approximation, besides the choice of the basis set for the electronic wavefunctions. Different approaches to the GW approximation have been implemented and tested, for example, the standard perturbative approach based on a prior mean-field calculation (Hartree-Fock GW@HF or density-functional theory GW@DFT) or the recently developed quasiparticle self-consistent method (QSGW). The highest occupied molecular orbital energies of atoms obtained from both GW@HF and QSGW are in excellent agreement with the experimental ionization energy. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies of the singly charged cation yield a noticeably worse estimate of the ionization energy. The best agreement with respect to experiment is obtained from the total energy differences within the random phase approximation functional, which is the total energy corresponding to the GW self-energy.

The results definitely indicate that the finite element method is both accurate and efficient and could serve as a useful tool in various single particle quantum mechanical problems.},

Our mesh generation scheme, in which structured atomic meshes are merged to an unstructured molecular mesh, allows a highly nonuniform discretization of the space. Thus it is possible to represent the core and valence states using the same discretization scheme, i.e., no pseudopotentials or similar treatments are required. The nonuniform discretization also allows the use of large simulation cells, and therefore avoids any boundary effects.},

abstract = {This paper investigates several factors affecting the accuracy and efficiency of numerical determination of the bound state energy eigenvalues of the one dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The efficiencies of the finite element method (FEM), the Numerov-Cooley method, and the finite difference method are compared. From this comparison, it is concluded that for potentials containing a single energy minimum, the Numerov-Cooley method is the most efficient, while for the most complex potentials the finite element method is superior due to its better numerical stability in the classically forbidden regions. The effects of various polynomial interpolation schemes on the calculated eigenvalues of potentials known only on a small number of points is examined. It is found that while higher order fits are superior to lower ones when the potential points are known accurately, they can introduce spurious information into the potential for inaccurately known points, and thus produce poor eigenvalues. Likewise, for accurately known potentials, a spline or Hermitian interpolation is better than a Lagrangian fit, but the Lagrangian functions are less susceptible to noise in a less well known case.},

abstract = {We extend the full-potential projector-augmented-wave method beyond the frozen core approximation, i.e., include the self-consistent optimization of the core charge density, in such a manner that the valence wave functions remain orthogonal to the core. The method consists of an on-the-fly repseudization of the all-electron problem, solving for the self-consistent core charge density within a spherical approximation. The key ideas in our procedure are to keep the projector functions fixed throughout the electronic minimization and to derive the new pseudopartial waves from these original projector functions, at each step of the electronic minimization procedure. Results of relaxed core calculations for atomic interconfigurational energies, structural energy differences between bulk phases of Fe, atomization energies of a subset of Pople's G2-1 set, and the Rh 3d surface core level shifts for the (log3 x log3)-Rh(111) surface at 1/3 CO coverage are presented.},

@article{Paier2005,
abstract = {Present local and semilocal functionals show significant errors, for instance, in the energetics of small molecules and in the description of band gaps. One possible solution to these problems is the introduction of exact exchange and hybrid functionals. A plane-wave-based algorithm was implemented in VASP (Vienna ab-initio simulation package) to allow for the calculation of the exact exchange. To systematically assess the precision of the present implementation, calculations for the 55 molecules of the G2-1 quantum chemical test set were performed applying the PBE and PBE0 functionals. Excellent agreement for both atomization energies and geometries compared with the results obtained by GAUSSIAN 03 calculations using large basis sets (augmented correlation consistent polarized valence quadruple zeta for the geometry optimization and augmented correlation-consistent polarized valence quintuple zeta for the energy calculations) was found. The mean absolute error for atomization energies between VASP and the experiment is 8.6 and 3.7 kcalmol, as calculated with the PBE and PBE0 functionals, respectively. The mean deviations between VASP and GAUSSIAN are 0.46 and 0.49 kcalmol for the PBE and PBE0 functionals, respectively.},

abstract = {The screening effect on the Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange term plays a key role in the investigation of solid-state materials by first-principles electronic structure calculations. We recently proposed a novel screened HF exchange potential, in which the inverse of the dielectric constant represents the fraction of the HF exchange term incorporated into the potential. We demonstrated that this approach can be used to reproduce the energy band structure of diamond well [T. Shimazaki and Y. Asai, J. Chem. Phys. 130, 164702 (2009)]. In the present paper, we report that the screened HF exchange method is applicable to other semiconductors such as silicon, AlP, AlAs, GaP, and GaAs.},

abstract = {Seven different types of Slater type basis sets for the elements H (Z = 1) up to E118 (Z = 118), ranging from a double zeta valence quality up to a quadruple zeta valence quality, are tested in their performance in neutral atomic and diatomic oxide calculations. The exponents of the Slater type functions are optimized for the use in (scalar relativistic) zeroth-order regular approximated (ZORA) equations. Atomic tests reveal that, on average, the absolute basis set error of 0.03 kcal/mol in the density functional calculation of the valence spinor energies of the neutral atoms with the largest all electron basis set of quadruple zeta quality is lower than the average absolute difference of 0.16 kcal/mol in these valence spinor energies if one compares the results of ZORA equation with those of the fully relativistic Dirac equation. This average absolute basis set error increases to about 1 kcal/mol for the all electron basis sets of triple zeta valence quality, and to approximately 4 kcal/mol for the all electron basis sets of double zeta quality. The molecular tests reveal that, on average, the calculated atomization energies of 118 neutral diatomic oxides MO, where the nuclear charge Z of M ranges from Z = 1-118, with the all electron basis sets of triple zeta quality with two polarization functions added are within 1-2 kcal/mol of the benchmark results with the much larger all electron basis sets, which are of quadruple zeta valence quality with four polarization functions added. The accuracy is reduced to about 4-5 kcal/mol if only one polarization function is used in the triple zeta basis sets, and further reduced to approximately 20 kcal/mol if the all electron basis sets of double zeta quality are used. The inclusion of g-type STOs to the large benchmark basis sets had an effect of less than 1 kcal/mol in the calculation of the atomization energies of the group 2 and group 14 diatomic oxides. The basis sets that are optimized for calculations using the frozen core approximation (frozen core basis sets) have a restricted basis set in the core region compared to the all electron basis sets. On average, the use of these frozen core basis sets give atomic basis set errors that are approximately twice as large as the corresponding all electron basis set errors and molecular atomization energies that are close to the corresponding all electron results. Only if spin-orbit coupling is included in the frozen core calculations larger errors are found, especially for the heavier elements, due to the additional approximation that is made that the basis functions are orthogonalized on scalar relativistic core orbitals.},

The approach is based on variational optimization of a MCSCF-type wave function augmented by a single geminal. This wave function is able to account for some dynamic correlation without explicit excitations to virtual molecular orbitals. Test calculations on two-electron systems demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to describe ionic and covalent electronic states in a balanced way, i.e., including the effects of both static and dynamic correlation simultaneously. Extension of the theory to larger systems will potentially provide an alternative to standard multireference methods.},

Case studies show that overall LISTi is the most robust and efficient algorithm for accelerating SCF convergence, whereas LISTd is advantageous in the early stage of an SCF process. More importantly, LISTi outperforms Pulay's direct inversion in the iterative subspace (DIIS) [P. Pulay, J. Comput. Chem. 3, 556 (1982)] and its two recent improvements, energy-DIIS [K. N. Kudin, G.

abstract = {Vertical ionization energies of C(60) and C(70) fullerenes are calculated with semidirect implementations of electron propagator methods and a triple-zeta plus polarization basis set. These predictions are in close agreement with photoelectron spectra for final states in which the Koopmans description is qualitatively valid. Many correlation states, where the latter description fails, are predicted by methods with nondiagonal self-energies.},

@article{Zhang2009,
abstract = {C(60) is a symbol of nanoscience. Its impact is far beyond the initial interest in this nanometer molecule itself. This paper reviews the current status of the nonlinear optical and ultrafast dynamics investigations of C(60). The review starts with the nonlinear optical response, in particular the dispersion spectra of harmonic generation and two-photon absorption. Both the experimental and theoretical challenges are highlighted. The main focus is on femtosecond and picosecond degenerate and nondegenerate four-wave mixing and pump-probe techniques as a tool to investigate ultrafast electron and nuclear dynamics, charge transfer and photoexcitation in C(60). Theoretical investigations are essential to understand these processes. Theory predicts a longer relaxation time for charge transfer than photoexcitation and reveals the underlying reasons for the normal mode excitations and changes in the electron density of states, which is directly linked to the time-resolved photoemission spectra. Theory also resolves a long-time puzzle about the dependence of normal mode excitations on the laser pulse duration and predicts that time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy is able to probe electron correlation effects. Finally, high-harmonic generation in C(60) is reviewed. The review concludes with prospectives and possible applications.},

abstract = {We present an all-electron method for time-dependent density functional theory which employs hierarchical nonuniform finite-element bases and the time-propagation approach. The method is capable of treating linear and nonlinear response of valence and core electrons to an external field. We also introduce (i) a preconditioner for the propagation equation, (ii) a stable way to implement absorbing boundary conditions, and (iii) a new kind of absorbing boundary condition inspired by perfectly matched layers.},
